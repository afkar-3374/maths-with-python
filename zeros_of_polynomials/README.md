# Zeros of Polynomials (Using Python)

This folder demonstrates how to find the **zeros of a polynomial**
using **three different methods** with Python.

The example polynomial used is:

h(x) = (-4x - 3)(x - 3)

---

## Methods Covered

### 1. Zero Product Property (Symbolic Method)
File: `symbolic_solution.py`

- Uses symbolic mathematics
- Directly solves h(x) = 0
- Returns exact fractional answers

---

### 2. Factor-by-Factor Method (Exam Style)
File: `factor_method.py`

- Solves each factor separately
- Clearly shows steps like:
  - -4x - 3 = 0
  - x - 3 = 0
- Matches written exam solutions

---

### 3. Graphical Method (Visual Verification)
File: `graph_visual.py`

- Plots the graph of the polynomial
- Zeros are shown where the graph cuts the x-axis
- Confirms algebraic answers visually
