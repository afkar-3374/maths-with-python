## Day 6 – CO1 (Matrices & Determinants with GUI)

Today, I started working on **CO1: Matrices and Determinants** using Python.

### What I did
- Revised the concept of **determinant of a 2×2 matrix**
- Converted the determinant formula into Python logic
- Built a **Tkinter-based GUI** for calculating the determinant
- Improved the UI with:
  - Dark theme
  - Matrix-style input layout
  - Step-by-step explanation showing how the determinant is calculated
- Displayed the solution in a clean, readable format instead of just the final answer

### Concepts Covered
- 2×2 matrix determinant
- Formula: |A| = ad − bc
- Connecting mathematical steps with code
- Using GUI to visualize and explain mathematical calculations

### Tools Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Basic algebra logic

### Outcome
Created an educational GUI tool that not only computes the determinant of a 2×2 matrix, but also **explains how the answer is obtained**, making the learning process clearer and more interactive.
